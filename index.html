          Heya, <br>
          <br>
          I'f you're looking for Marc's web-development portfolio then you've come to the right place. <br>
          <br>
          This is the space where you can check out all the projects I've been working on and learn a little bit more
          about me.
          <br>
          I currently hold a bachelors degree in Business and have studied abroad at Greenwich University in London. I
          have love travelling and so far I've been lucky enough to visit 32 countries. I'm hoping to reach 50 before my
          50th birthday.
          <br>
          Currently, I'm spending my days expanding my knowledge of web-development and coding at Adelaide University.
          <br>
          I'm excited to put my skills into practice. <br>
          Before you check out the rest of my portfolio, I'll leave you with my favourite quote...<br>
          <br>
          "Life begins at the edge of your comfort zone."
          <br>

          <p> The brief for this project was to debug existing code to ensure the web page functioned effectively as
            well as clean up
            the CSS code where necessary.</p>
